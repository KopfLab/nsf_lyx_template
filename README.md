# NSF Lyx Template

Based on https://github.com/sebkopf/NSF-LaTeX-Template and https://github.com/mkmcc/nsf-template with code borrowed directly from these repositories and simply adapted for use with Lyx.

The usual disclaimer: absolutely no guarantee for accuracy or NSF compliance - you have to make sure everything is compliant with current NSF guidelines and the specific program solicitation.

# Notes

Open, edit and render individual lyx files for each section. Instructions copied from the 2016 PPAG available in individual files but may be out of date. Render the `0_proposal.lyx` file for a combined overview of the full proposal. However, fastlane requires individual sections. Code for splitting the PDF automatically is in the works.
